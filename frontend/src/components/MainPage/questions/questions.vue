						<span class="text-title">Accuracy of measurements</span>
						<p class="text-regular">
							The test equipment that we develop and manufacture is intended for
							thorough and trustworthy inspections, and is compatible with all ELT
							brands. Our testers provide a high level of measurement accuracy.
							You can be sure that the parameters of the beacon that you are
							testing really meet the requirements and are within the tolerance.
						</p>

						<span class="text-title">Realiability of operation</span>
						<p class="text-regular">
							The testers are tolerant to temperature drop and can operate at high
							humidity (all their elements are protected for this). Due to the use
							of special filters (circuits configured in a narrow band), no
							extraneous interference can affect the testing.
						</p>

						<span class="text-title">Quality of production</span>
						<p class="text-regular">
							We design our tools for a long service life, that’s why we do not
							compromise by using cheap components. This approach, which also
							includes careful manual assembly, allows us to produce devices with
							a reject rate of only 0.2% and maintain an optimal price-quality
							ratio for our devices.<br>
							The supplied testers’ sets include already all components that
							are necessary for measurements: RF attenuator, RF cables, adapters, etc.
						</p>

						<span class="text-title">Easy making of test reports</span>
						<p class="text-regular">
							Along with the testers, we supply specialized software that allows
							to automate the process of generating test reports. You only
							need to print them and sign - minimum of routine paperwork!
							The software is included to the cost of testers and is available
							for downloading on this website.
